# matrix-determinant-

example of a function in C that calculates the determinant of a matrix:
This function calculates the determinant of an nxn matrix using a recursive algorithm. It first checks if the matrix is a 2x2 matrix, in which case it calculates the determinant directly using the formula for a 2x2 determinant. If the matrix is larger than 2x2, it uses a recursive approach to calculate the determinant by dividing the matrix into smaller submatrices and applying the same formula to each submatrix.
